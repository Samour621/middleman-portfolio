            <h2>The long story:</h2>
            <p>In 2017, I traded the rolling green hills of Vermont to move across the globe to the bustling city of Seoul, South Korea after receiving the Korean Government Scholarship (KGSP). I was able to acquire not only a Masters degree in International Relations from Hanyang University, but also a Business Certification and deeper understanding of the Korean language.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately COVID arrived around the same time as my graduation, having me to make the choice of leaving or staying in Korea. Lucky for me, I made a wise choice and decided to stay! This allowed me to find a job right after graduation in an early beauty-tech startup on the Social Media and Marketing team. With only four employees (including the CEO), it was truly a sink or swim environment. But despite the challenges, the speed at which I learned was astronomical.</P>
            <p>I discovered that I love a fast-paced and dynamic environment that allows for trying new things and team collaboration. And thanks to this environment, I was able to build upon a passion. Design! The success of our social media thanks to a well designed content strategy gave me confidence and excitement moving forward. I also partook in designing UI/UX elements of the beauty app, along with packaging and merchandise. I'm truly grateful for this experience for it helped to harness the creativity and skills I already had and strengthen them!</p>
            <p>After 3 years, I decided the environment no longer could foster the growth I wished for. So I set my sites on career and personal development, through the exploration of new cultures and gaining new technical skills. Traveling 15 countries in 4 months and participating in a 9 week-intensive web development bootcamp helped me shape my desired path forward.</p>
            <p>Of course, there were many other teachings and freelance positions that have helped nurture further growth. But to keep this TLDR about me to a readable length, I'd be happy to share those experiences through a deeper conversation! Please feel free to reach out through any of the methods provided on my site! </p>
